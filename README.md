1. Begin by downloading the necessary files from the repository.

2. Extract the downloaded files and open the config.json file in a text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

3. Create a webhook on Discord by following these steps: Create a server, navigate to settings > Integrations, click on Create Webhook, and copy the generated webhook URL.

4. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a discord bot, copy the token and client id (remember to enable the 3 checkboxes under Privileged Gateway Intents).

5. Choose a domain-name you will put for your webapp later, this is IMPORTANT. Choose anything random (like https://myfunnybotstuff0.onrender.com), no one else will see this domain

8. Replace the existing content inside the config.json file with the stuff you just created.

9. Upload the modified files to a GitHub repository.

10. Head to dashboard.render.com, create a web service, and link it to your GitHub repository.
  
11. Keep most settings as default, but make the following adjustments:
  Build Command: npm i
  Start Command: npm run deploy
> Building the application on Onrender will take a while due to the package respobsible for auto-otp.

12. Once the web app is live, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/1186830876315758644/bot > OAuth2 and create a invite link. Enable commands and bot > admin access. (You may now invite the bot and use it however you desire, but remember that its your own responsibily)

  Send messages,
  React to messages,
  Create public threads,
  Create private threads

Do /embed [title] [description].
